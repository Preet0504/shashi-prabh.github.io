Introduction and course objectives

We are going through severe crisis caused by Covid-19 pandemic. Among other things, this crisis has rendered conducting group activities, such as lecturing a number of students in a classroom, nearly impossible. We are mitigating the devastating impact of the pandemic by substituting physical presence with a virtual one which would not have been possible without computer networks. The Internet had a humble beginning with just four nodes in 1969. Today with over 4 billion users and billions of devices connected to the Internet, it is the lifeblood of the governments and the economy all over the world.

This is a first course on computer networks. In this course, the students will learn the fundamentals of computer networking.  The students will get exposed to the design of scalable networking architecture that has sustained the exponential growth of the Internet. The students will learn the layered architecture, basics of physical layer, and details of link, network and transport layers. The students will learn the functionalities as well as the protocols pertaining to these layers.

Helpful Advice ( a.k.a. expectation from the students! )

Pay attention and take notes! Get doubts cleared during the lecture itself -- do not hesitate to ask questions in class. Before attending a lecture, review your notes and scan the portion of the textbook that will be covered (see the course calendar page here). Do assignments on your own. If you happen to miss some session(s), do talk to someone else who attended or the TA to find out the topics covered and any announcement made.
